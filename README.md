# UFOs
## Overview of Project: 
During this very interesting project, we helped Dana tell a particular story. One that involves her hometown, McMinnville, Oregon, and the many UFO's sightings. This has been a topic that has sparked Dana's curiosity since she was a child, and we worked together, using Javascript, to create a visually attractive and tidy html page were fans can explore her findings thanks to easy-to-use filters to sort the large amount of data available. 


## Results: 
This html page is very easy to use. Once to click on the link, you are directed to our UFO's Sightings page. At the bottom of the page, you will find several filter boxes which you can use to pick and choose the results you want to see. Sightings can be filtered by date, city, state, country and shape. The page was desgined to be simple, there ir no need to click on anything for the filters to work. You just have to type in the boxes and wait for the table to load again, almost immeadiatle. 

As we can see in the images, this is how the page looks like without any filters:

This is how the table looks like when the filter by state is applied to the information:

On the other hand, here is the information when two filters are applied at the same time:

Lastly, presented here are the results when every filter is filled out:

## Summary: 
In conclusion, this was a fun and interesting project. Filters are a great way to make it easier for researchers to evaluate and draw conclusions out of big amounts of data. One drawback is that once you change the filters, the whole table will update again and the information from the previous filter will be lost. As a recommendation, perhaps we could add on a new feature were fans can download different versions of the table with the filtered information they requested. Another possible improvement to the dataset would be to add pictures and addresses from the sightings, or to include information from other countries.
